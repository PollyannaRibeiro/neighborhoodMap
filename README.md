# Neighborhood Map Project

It's a project for Udacity's React course.

### Goal:
Developing a single page application featuring a map of your neighbourhood or a neighbourhood you would like to visit. Adding functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### What learn with that?

How design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase. Understanding and exploring how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities to use. Finally, implementing third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.


# Challenges on this project

It was the first project that I built from scratch, without any existing starter code or model to follow. 

I decided to build an App with the Museums of the central area of London, including on that the respective links to Wikipedia. That way, the user could have more information about these places easily. 

I made my own design decisions. I needed to draw some ideas to organize how it would be built. Breaking it into components, studying Google Maps API and, finally,I started building this project.
